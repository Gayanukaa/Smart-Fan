## Features
- **Smart Rotation**: Utilizes face detection to adjust the fan's rotation angle based on user location within a 5-meter range.
- **Distance-Based Speed Control**: Generates PWM signals based on the user's distance, enabling precise fan speed adjustments.
- **Environmental Sensing**: Monitors and adjusts fan operation based on temperature and humidity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides manual control through LabVIEW for customizable settings.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces energy consumption by dynamically adjusting fan operations.

## Documentation

The block diagram below illustrates how the components of the Smart Table Fan system interact:

- **Raspberry Pi**: Processes video input from the webcam for face detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe, calculates distance, and controls the fan's rotation angle.
- **Webcam**: Captures real-time video to detect user presence and measure distance.
- **LabVIEW**: Integrates data from sensors and controls the system, managing fan speed and rotation.
- **Servo Motor**: Adjusts the fan's direction based on the user's position.
- **DC Motor**: Modulates fan speed according to PWM signals from the Raspberry Pi and power supply controlled by LabVIEW.
- **NI DAQ mx**: Acquires data from various sensors and actuators, providing real-time feedback to the LabVIEW interface.
- **Rigol Variable DC Power Supply**: Modifies fan speed based on control signals from LabVIEW and the Raspberry Pi.


## Getting StartedüöÄ
To explore the project, please follow these steps:
 1) Clone the repository.
 2) Install the necessary software and packages.
 3) Connect the hardware components as per the block diagram.
 4) Run the LabVIEW interface to start the fan and monitor its operations.

## LabVIEW Control‚öôÔ∏è

LabVIEW processes all three system inputs from the sensors to adjust the fan speed, maintains the connection with the programmable DC power supply, and integrates a dashboard to monitor real-time data and system status.
